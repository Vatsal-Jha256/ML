# Machine Learning Practice Codes
My implementations for building intuition in ML

This repo documents my hands-on journey into the world of machine learning through coding up algorithms, techniques, and concepts across disciplines like:

    Regression
    Classification
    Clustering
    Deep Learning
    NLP
    Dimensionality Reduction
    Boosting
    Model Selection
    Reinforcement Learning

Primary source is the Udemy course "Machine Learning A-Z" but I incorporate learnings from other materials as well.

Each section features Jupyter notebooks delving into libraries like Scikit-Learn, Keras, PyTorch, and key papers. Through annotations and documentation, I aim to map out the intracies of both seminal and cutting-edge ML.

This will evolve over time into an integrated resource for picking up practical ML experience. Feedback is welcome!
